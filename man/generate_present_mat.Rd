\title{Generate a logical presence matrix from counts and thresholds}
\usage{
generate_present_mat(count_mat, count_thresh, freq_thresh)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_mat}{Numeric matrix of variant counts (rows = variants,
columns = samples).}

\item{count_thresh}{Integer minimum count threshold for presence.}

\item{freq_thresh}{Numeric minimum VAF threshold for presence.}
}
\value{
A logical matrix of the same dimension as \code{count_mat} with
\code{TRUE} indicating presence.
}
\description{
Create a logical matrix indicating presence/absence of variants in samples
based on count and VAF thresholds.
}
\details{
Variant allele frequencies are computed as \code{count / depth}, where
\code{depth} is the column sum of \code{count_mat}. A cell is considered
present if its count is greater than or equal to \code{count_thresh} and
its VAF is greater than or equal to \code{freq_thresh}.
