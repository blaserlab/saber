\title{Variant recurrence vs entropy diagnostic plot for a \code{Saber} object}
\usage{
plot_saber_variant_entropy(x, show_thresholds = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{Saber} object.}

\item{show_thresholds}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), draw vertical and
horizontal lines at \code{min_samples} and \code{entropy_thresh} taken
from \code{x@thresholds}, when available.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Create a scatter plot of the number of samples in which each variant is
observed versus its normalized entropy across samples. Variants are colored
by their \code{is_recurrent} flag, and optional threshold lines indicate
the recurrence and entropy cutoffs used when calling stereotyped junk.
}
\details{
The plot is based on the \code{recurrent_variants} slot of \code{x} and
only includes variants where \code{is_no_variant == FALSE}. The x-axis
is the number of samples in which the variant is present (after thresholding),
and the y-axis is the normalized entropy across samples. Variants flagged
as recurrent stereotyped junk (\code{is_recurrent == TRUE}) are typically
found in the upper-right region of the plot.
