\title{Correlation between matched Saber samples across timepoints}
\usage{
saber_cor(x, mapping, method = c("pearson", "spearman"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List of \code{Saber} objects.}

\item{mapping}{Tibble/data frame with a \code{true_id} column and one
column per timepoint containing sample IDs (e.g. output of
\code{cross_sabers()}).  Optionally pre-filter the tibble (e.g. exclude unmatched samples).}

\item{method}{Correlation method: \code{"pearson"} or \code{"spearman"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of sample–sample correlations.
}
\description{
Given a list of \code{Saber} objects and a mapping (typically from
\code{cross_sabers()}), compute a correlation matrix between all matched
samples across all timepoints, based on shared barcodes.
}
