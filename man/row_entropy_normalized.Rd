\title{Row-wise normalized entropy (variant-level)}
\usage{
row_entropy_normalized(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of counts for a single variant across samples.}
}
\value{
A single numeric scalar in \eqn{[0, 1]} giving the normalized entropy.
}
\description{
Compute the normalized Shannon entropy of a numeric vector, typically
representing counts of a single variant across samples. Entropy is computed
on the non-zero entries only and normalized to lie in \eqn{[0, 1]} by
dividing by \eqn{\log(m)}, where \eqn{m} is the number of non-zero entries.
}
\details{
This helper is intended for internal use when quantifying how evenly a
given barcode/variant is distributed across samples. Values near 0 indicate
that counts are concentrated in a single sample (clone-like), whereas values
near 1 indicate counts are spread evenly across many samples (stereotyped
motif-like).
