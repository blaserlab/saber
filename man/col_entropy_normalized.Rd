\title{Column-wise normalized entropy (sample-level)}
\usage{
col_entropy_normalized(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of counts for all variants in one sample.}
}
\value{
A single numeric scalar in \eqn{[0, 1]} giving the normalized entropy.
}
\description{
Compute the normalized Shannon entropy of a numeric vector, typically
representing counts of all variants within a single sample. Entropy is
computed on the non-zero entries only and normalized to \eqn{[0, 1]}.
}
\details{
This helper is used internally to summarize per-sample diversity of barcodes
before and after filtering stereotyped recurrent variants.
