\title{Identify top-\code{n} variants per sample}
\usage{
top_n_rownames_by_column(mat, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Numeric matrix of values (rows = variants, columns = samples).}

\item{n}{Integer scalar; number of top variants to select per sample.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per sample, a \code{sample_name} column, and
\code{top_1} to \code{top_n} columns containing variant IDs.
}
\description{
For each column (sample) of a numeric matrix, return the row names
corresponding to the top \code{n} values. The result is a tibble with one
row per sample and columns \code{top_1}, \code{top_2}, ..., \code{top_n}.
}
\details{
If row names are missing, they are created as character indices
(\code{"1"}, \code{"2"}, ...). If column names are missing, they are created
as \code{"col1"}, \code{"col2"}, etc. For each sample, the row names of the
top \code{n} entries are returned in descending order of the column values.
If a sample has fewer than \code{n} non-\code{NA} entries, the remaining
positions are padded with \code{NA}.
