\title{Match current timepoint samples to the first timepoint using distances}
\usage{
match_to_first_timepoint(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of length at least 2 of \code{Saber} objects, where
\code{x[[1]]} is the reference (first timepoint) and \code{x[[2]]}
is the timepoint to be matched.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{true_id} (sample from first timepoint)
and one column named after \code{names(x)[2]} containing matched sample
IDs from that timepoint. Only one-to-one matches are retained.
}
\description{
Compute a one-to-one mapping from samples at a later timepoint to samples
at the first timepoint based on Euclidean distances in scaled barcode
count space.
