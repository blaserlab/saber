\title{Cross-link barcoded samples across multiple \code{Saber} timepoints}
\usage{
cross_sabers(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Named list of \code{Saber} objects, ordered by timepoint. List
names are used as timepoint labels in the output.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per putative individual (\code{true_id}) and
one column per timepoint name, containing the sample IDs from each
timepoint that best match that individual (or \code{NA} if no unambiguous
match was found).
}
\description{
Use distances in barcode count space to link samples across a series of
timepoints represented by \code{Saber} objects. The first element of
\code{x} is treated as the reference timepoint, and all later timepoints
are matched directly to this reference.
