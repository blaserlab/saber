\description{
The \code{Saber} class is an S7 object that encapsulates the results of
CRISPR barcode filtering and quality control, including the filtered
variant count matrix, recurrent (stereotyped) variants, per-sample and
per-variant QC summaries, and the thresholds/parameters used to construct
the object.
}
\details{
Objects of class \code{Saber} are typically constructed via
\code{\link{make.Saber}()}, which performs empirical threshold estimation,
permutation-based detection of recurrent stereotyped variants, and
downstream QC summarization.

The class is defined with the following properties:
\describe{
\item{description}{Character scalar describing the dataset or analysis.}
\item{filtered_counts}{Matrix of variant counts with stereotyped junk and
"no variant" rows removed (variants x samples).}
\item{recurrent_variants}{Tibble/data frame of per-variant recurrence and
entropy metrics, including flags for recurrent stereotyped variants and
"no variant" rows.}
\item{motif_blacklist}{Character vector of variant identifiers treated as
uninformative (either recurrent stereotyped variants or "no variant"
background).}
\item{per_sample_uniques}{Tibble/data frame summarizing per-sample counts
of unique informative barcodes.}
\item{per_sample_qc}{Tibble/data frame of per-sample QC metrics, including
total reads, fractions in kept/recurrent/no-variant reads, and sample
entropy before and after filtering.}
\item{per_variant_qc}{Tibble/data frame of per-variant collision
probabilities and related metrics.}
\item{thresholds}{List of thresholds and analysis parameters used to
construct the object (e.g., count/VAF thresholds, minimum sample depth,
permutation settings).}
}

The validator checks that \code{filtered_counts} is a matrix and that
\code{recurrent_variants}, \code{per_sample_uniques}, \code{per_sample_qc},
and \code{per_variant_qc} are tibbles (\code{"tbl_df"}).
