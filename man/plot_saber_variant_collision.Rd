\title{Variant collision risk plot for a \code{Saber} object}
\usage{
plot_saber_variant_collision(x, p_ge2_thresh = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{Saber} object.}

\item{p_ge2_thresh}{Numeric scalar; variants with
\code{P_ge2_given_present >= p_ge2_thresh} are highlighted. Defaults to
\code{0.05} (5\\%).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Visualize per-variant collision probabilities to identify barcode variants
that are likely to arise more than once independently in a sample.
}
\details{
This function uses the \code{per_variant_qc} slot of \code{x} (via
\code{\link{variant_data}()}). The primary plot is a scatter plot of
\code{n_samples_present} (x-axis) versus \code{P_ge2_given_present}
(y-axis), where \code{P_ge2_given_present} is the model-based probability
that a variant arises at least twice in a sample, conditional on being
observed at least once.

A horizontal dashed line is drawn at \code{p_ge2_thresh}. Axis limits are
set to the observed ranges of \code{n_samples_present} and
\code{P_ge2_given_present} so that all data points are included in the
plotting region.
